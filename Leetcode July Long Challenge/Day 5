The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

Given two integers x and y, calculate the Hamming distance.

Note:
0 ≤ x, y < 231.

Example:

Input: x = 1, y = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.




C++	

class Solution {
public:
      int hammingDistance(int x, int y) {
      
          int value=x^y;
          int setBits=0;
          while(value>0){

            setBits+=value&1;
            value=value>>1;

        }

        return setBits;
}
};
