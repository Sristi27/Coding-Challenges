<h1>Arranging Coins</h1>
You have a total of n coins that you want to form in a staircase shape, where every k-th row must have exactly k coins.
Given n, find the total number of full staircase rows that can be formed.
n is a non-negative integer and fits within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

Example 1:

n = 5

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:

n = 8

The coins can form the following rows:
¤
¤ ¤
¤ ¤ ¤
¤ ¤

Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.

Solution:
 
class Solution {
public:
    int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        
        int i=1;
        while(i<=n){
            
           float c=(i*(i+1))/2;
           // cout<<c;
            if(c>(float)n) return i-1;
            else if(c==(float)n) return i;
            else i++;
                    
            
        }
        return 0;
    }
};
