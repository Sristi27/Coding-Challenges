Question: Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

//Python Solution

class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        for i in range(len(s)//2):
        //Just swap the characters
            tmp=s[i]
            s[i]=s[len(s)-i-1]
            s[len(s)-i-1]=tmp
